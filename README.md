# ParaBank Playwright Exercise

End-to-end test suite targeting **[ParaBank](https://parabank.parasoft.com)** — Parasoft's public banking demo, used as a realistic playground for Playwright practice.

Unlike the [Stripe exercise](../stripe-playwright-exercise/README.md), no local app is required: ParaBank is hosted by Parasoft, so you can run the suite immediately after `npm install`.

## What this exercise covers

ParaBank exposes a full banking UI: register, login, open account, transfer funds, bill pay, request loan, find transactions. It also ships a **REST API** (`/parabank/services/bank/*`) that we use for **cross-validation** — assert the UI *and* the backend state, not just one or the other.

The exercise focuses on:

- Register → Login → Transfer end-to-end
- Multi-step flows with session state
- Cross-validation UI ↔ REST API (the "fintech mindset" part)
- Deterministic tests against a **shared public environment** (no test pollution)

## Test plan & exploration

- [`docs/exploration-notes.md`](docs/exploration-notes.md) — what the site actually does: URLs, forms, APIs, quirks observed during manual exploration.
- [`docs/test-plan.md`](docs/test-plan.md) — FMEA-light risk matrix (Probability × Impact × Detectability), test cases, traceability, anti-flaky strategy.

Read both before writing new tests — they explain **why** each scenario matters and **how** to keep the suite deterministic on a shared public environment.

## Determinism rules

Five non-negotiable rules, the same as the Stripe exercise:

1. **Zero `waitForTimeout()`** — use `expect(locator).toBeVisible()` with auto-retry
2. **Zero uncontrolled network** — no passive waiting for async effects
3. **Zero shared state between tests** — every test creates its own user via `userFactory`
4. **Zero fragile selectors** — `getByRole` / `getByLabel` only, no generated CSS classes
5. **Zero decorative assertions** — assert on URL, API responses, and balances, not on "Welcome!"

Merge threshold: **10/10 on 10 consecutive CI runs**. No `test.retry()` to mask flakiness.

---

## Known constraints of ParaBank

ParaBank is a **shared public environment**, so tests have to behave accordingly:

- **Users can collide** → `userFactory` appends a timestamp + random suffix to every username
- **Data is not reset** between runs → tests never rely on an empty state
- **The site can go down** → `globalSetup` does a health check with retry before the suite runs
- **The REST API is on a different port** (`:8080`) and may be slow → used only for cross-validation, not as the main path
- **No teardown of created users** — ParaBank doesn't expose a delete-user endpoint; we accept the data accumulation

---

## Next steps

Once V1 is green and stable:

- Add TC-05 (Bill Pay) and TC-06 (Request Loan)
- Add API-only tests hitting `/parabank/services/bank/*` directly (pre-seed accounts via API, assert via UI)
- Add TC-07 with date-range filtering and table assertions
- Investigate double-submit on Transfer (risk R3 in the test plan)
